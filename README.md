# CPSC_3620_BST_Node_Counter-
This program utilizes 3 different recursive algorithms to count leaf, full, and all nodes in a BST

This program is concerned with being able to differentiate between the different types of nodes in a BST and counting
them using recursive algorithms. 

This program utilizes a Dictionary abstract class to implement a binary search tree. Also included is an abstract class that is used to implement the Binary Search Tree Node object.
